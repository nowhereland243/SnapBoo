Edit `tailwind.config.ts`:

colors: {
  primary: {
    // Change these hex values

    600: '#db2777',  // Darker pink
    // ... etc
  }
}
```

All text is in the component files:

- Homepage: `/app/page.tsx`, `/components/home/`
- Product: `/app/product/[handle]/page.tsx`
- About: `/app/about/page.tsx`

### Update Stock Count

Currently hardcoded to 100. When Shopify is connected, this will be automatic.
